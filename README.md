# Predicting_Bike_Sharing
In this project, I have build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, I have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher level tools such as PyTorch.
